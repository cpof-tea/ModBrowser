<p>They must be installed from Origin, GOG, or the discs.</p>

<h3>For Steam users</h3>
<p>Due to Steam's DRM, there are known issues with using mods on Steam versions of Spore. However, you may <a href="getspore#registerorigin">redeem a free Origin copy of the game</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we cannot offer further support for modding Steam versions of the game at this time.</p>

<h2>Additional Information</h2>

<h3>Getting support</h3>
<p>You can ask for help in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://discord.gg/YUcJWtb">Spore Modding Community</a> Discord server. Use the <strong>#mod-support</strong> channel for all questions regarding installing or using mods. Please make sure you follow the rules in #server-rules.</p>
<p>It may be helpful to post a screenshot of your Easy Uninstaller, as it lists all mods you have installed, as well as the version numbers for Spore ModAPI and the launcher kit. To take a screenshot on Windows, open Spore ModAPI Easy Uninstaller, press Alt+PrntScrn, and then paste in the Discord channel.</p>

<h3>Manual installation and .package mods</h3>
<p>In the past, Spore mods were installed by placing .package files in the game's data directory. While this method remains functional for mods that are distributed as .package files, this will not work for any mod with a .sporemod file extension. <strong>You must use the Spore ModAPI Launcher Kit to install these mods.</strong> The new format enables far more capabilities for modding, as well as making it easier to install, configure, and manage mods.</p>
<p>All mods (including .package mods) can be installed with the Spore ModAPI Launcher Kit, so you are encouraged to install all mods using it.</p>
